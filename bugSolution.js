The solution is to ensure that any values used within the asynchronous function are obtained from the current component's state *within* the asynchronous function's body.  This prevents stale closures. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```javascript
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const fetchData = useCallback(async () => {
    const currentCount = count; // Capture the current count
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/data/${currentCount}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    // ... process data using currentCount
  }, [count]);

  return (
    // ... rest of component
  );
}
```

By capturing `count` inside the `fetchData` function, we guarantee the latest value is used during the asynchronous operation.  Alternatively, one could entirely remove the useCallback and just use a regular function.
