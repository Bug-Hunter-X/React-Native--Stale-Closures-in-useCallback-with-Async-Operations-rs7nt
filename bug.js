In React Native, a fairly uncommon bug can arise from improper usage of the `useCallback` hook in conjunction with asynchronous operations.  If you're using `useCallback` to memoize a function that internally makes an asynchronous call (e.g., fetching data from an API), and you're not careful, you might end up with stale closures. This occurs because the memoized function retains a reference to the variables from its creation scope, even if those variables change on subsequent renders. For instance, consider this scenario:

```javascript
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const fetchData = useCallback(async () => {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/data/${count}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    // ... process data
  }, [count]); // count is in the dependency array

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
      <Button title="Fetch Data" onPress={fetchData} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

If `fetchData` is called *after* `count` has been incremented, it will still use the older value of `count` from when `useCallback` initially memoized it because it is now closed over this older value. The solution involves ensuring that any asynchronous operations within the memoized function use the latest values by making them part of the function body itself.
